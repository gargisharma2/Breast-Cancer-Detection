# 🧬 Breast Cancer Detection using Machine Learning

This project involves detecting breast cancer using machine learning models on the Breast Cancer Wisconsin dataset. The aim is to classify whether a tumor is malignant or benign based on various features.

## 📁 Dataset

The dataset used is the [Breast Cancer Wisconsin Diagnostic Data Set](https://archive.ics.uci.edu/ml/datasets/Breast+Cancer+Wisconsin+(Diagnostic)). It contains features computed from digitized images of fine needle aspirate (FNA) of breast masses.

- **Features**: 30 numeric features including radius, texture, perimeter, area, smoothness, etc.
- **Target**: Diagnosis (M = Malignant, B = Benign)

## 🧰 Tools & Libraries Used

- Python  
- Jupyter Notebook  
- pandas  
- numpy  
- matplotlib  
- seaborn  
- scikit-learn

## ⚙️ Work Done

- Loaded and explored the dataset  
- Checked for missing values and cleaned the data  
- Visualized feature distributions and correlations  
- Label-encoded the target variable  
- Split data into training and testing sets  
- Built and evaluated machine learning models:
  - Logistic Regression  
  - K-Nearest Neighbors (KNN)  
  - Support Vector Machine (SVM)  
- Compared model performances using accuracy and confusion matrix

## 📊 Results

The best-performing model achieved over **95% accuracy** on the test set, demonstrating the effectiveness of machine learning in medical diagnosis tasks.
